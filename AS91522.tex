	\section{Vertical Circle: Loop the loop including Dip and Arch}
	\subsection{Achieved}
	During motion, 3 forces are acting on the stunt glider:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Gravity ($\vec{F_g}$) (i.e. Weight) always vertically downwards (i.e. toward center of Earth).
		\item Lift ($\vec{F_L}$) perpendicular to direction of velocity, toward the center of the circular path.
		\item Air Resistance ($\vec{F_R}$) (i.e. Friction, Drag) opposite to direction of velocity.
	\end{enumerate}
	\vspace{\ParagraphSpacing}
	The force of gravity is always constant in both magnitude and direction (vertically downwards) regardless of the glider's velocity or position in the loop (top, bottom, and anywhere else). This is because $|\vec{F_g}|=mg$ where mass ($m$) and the acceleration of gravity ($g$) are constants.\\[\ParagraphSpacing]
	Conversely, the force of lift varies in both direction and magnitude as the glider performs the loop the loop.\\
	Lift's magnitude ($|\vec{F_L}|$) is greatest at the bottom, $\because |\vec{F_L}|=\frac{1}{2}p|\vec{v}|^2AC_L$, $\therefore |\vec{F_L}|\propto v^2$. Because velocity is greatest at bottom, lift force is as well. To maintain circular motion the centripetal force ($|\vec{F_{c_\text{bottom}}}|=|\vec{F_L}|-|\vec{F_g}|$) towards the center of the circular path must have a magnitude value great enough to provide necessary centripetal acceleration for the circular path radius, meaning the lift force upwards must at least be greater than the gravity force downwards ($|\vec{F_L}|>|\vec{F_g}|$ in order for $|\vec{F_c}|>0$).\\
	Lift's magnitude ($|\vec{F_L}|$) is least at the top, because the direction of gravity force is toward the center of the circular path. This means ($|\vec{F_{c_\text{top}}}|=|\vec{F_L}|+|\vec{F_g}|$).\\

	\end{figure}
	At the bottom of the vertical circle, the tension force (emulating the lift force, $\vec{F_L}$) is greatest, which occurs at 15.82 seconds with 5.89N.\\
	Once the force meter (emulating motion of glider) reaches the top of the vertical circle, the tension force is at its least, which - when smoothing the curve of data and reducing random variation/noise - occurs at\\
	Check if sine model or quadratic helps - then return to this section.\\
	During the loop the loop, as the glider ascends, its kinetic energy ($E_K$) is converted into gravitational potential energy ($E_p$). As the glider descends, its gravitational potential energy ($E_p$) is converted back into kinetic energy ($E_K$).\\
	
	\subsection{Merit}
	\begin{align}
		E_K&=\frac{1}{2}m|\vec{v}|^2\\
		\therefore |\vec{v}|^2&\propto E_K\\
		|\vec{v}|&\propto \sqrt{E_K}
	\end{align}
	During the loop the loop, as the glider ascends, its kinetic energy ($E_K$) is converted into gravitational potential energy ($E_p$). This decreases its velocity as it is proportional to kinetic energy, which decreased when converted to gravitational potential energy. \\
	As the glider descends, its gravitational potential energy ($E_p$) is converted back into kinetic energy ($E_K$).This increases its velocity as it is proportional to kinetic energy, which increased when the gravitational potential energy was converted back into it.\\[\ParagraphSpacing]
	A glider's ability to successfully perform a vertical loop relies on its ability to provide an adequate lift force, increasing both net and centripetal force.
	\begin{align}
		|\vec{F_L}|&=\frac{1}{2}p|\vec{v}|^2AC_L \label{eq:lift}\\
		\therefore |\vec{F_L}|&\propto |\vec{v}|^2 \label{eq:lift-prop-vel} \\[\baselineskip]
		|\vec{F_{L_\text{top}}}|&=|\vec{F_c}|-|\vec{F_g}|\\
		&=\frac{m|\vec{v}|^2}{r}-m|\vec{g}|\label{eq:lift-top} \\[\baselineskip]
		|\vec{F_{L_\text{bottom}}}|&=|\vec{F_c}|+|\vec{F_g}|\\
		&=\frac{m|\vec{v}|^2}{r}+m|\vec{g}| \label{eq:lift-bottom}
	\end{align}
	\cref{eq:lift-prop-vel}, \cref{eq:lift-top}, and \cref{eq:lift-bottom} show that velocity is a major factor in the magnitude of the lift force. Without adequate velocity, inadequate lift force and consequently inadequate centripetal acceleration is provided, causing an unsuccessful vertical loop. As kinetic energy is converted to gravitational potential energy during ascent, if the velocity drops below what is required for the circular path radius its motion will instead imitate that of a projectile. (Side note: This oversimplification is more true for the tension force model, less so for an actual glider. The lift force won't simply disappear even if it fails a vertical circular path, as indicated by \cref{eq:lift}. Because of this, in reality, it won't perfectly meet the criteria of what is defined as projectile motion)\\
	Other factors proportional to the lift force ($\vec{F_L}$) include surface area contacting air ($A$), and the coefficient of lift ($C_L$), determined by shape and angle of attack).\\
	Fluid density ($p$) is constant.\\[\ParagraphSpacing]
	During motion, 3 forces are acting on the stunt glider:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Gravity ($\vec{F_g}$) (i.e. Weight) always vertically downwards (i.e. toward center of Earth).
		\item Lift ($\vec{F_L}$) perpendicular to direction of velocity, toward the center of the circular path.
		\item Air Resistance ($\vec{F_R}$) (i.e. Friction, Drag) opposite to direction of velocity.
	\end{enumerate}

	\end{figure}
	Quadratic curve fit is applied to closely fit the lift force data in the section of the dip motion from 18.50s to 18.88s. It helps exclude random variation / noise in the data and provide consistent smoothness and symmetry. The line displayed in the center marks 18.68s, which is when the emulated glider reaches its lowest vertical height (i.e. lowest point in the dip), also aligning with the local peak in the emulated lift force at 6.29N. The reason for the greatest lift force being required at the bottom of the loop the loop is due to its direction oppositely opposing gravity, requiring the greatest magnitude to provide sufficient centripetal force for the vertical loop's radius. The velocity is also greatest here as it has the greatest $E_K:E_P$ ratio (i.e. $\frac{E_K}{E_P}$ is at its greatest in the time series) (as previously explained) which is a major factor in causing that required greatest lift force (as explained in previous equations) $\because E_K\propto|\vec{v}|^2\propto |\vec{F_L}|$).

Unless its velocity was perfectly zero (completely stationary), \cref{eq:lift} and \cref{eq:lift-prop-vel} prove there must also be a lift force. Depending on the velocity (ranging from minimum to excessive), that lift force could range from negligible to decently large.\\
	\cref{eq:min-vel} represents the minimum velocity $|\vec{v}|$ required to produce adequate centripetal acceleration $|\vec{a_c}|$ for a circular path with radius $r$.
	\begin{align}
		|\vec{a_c}|&=\frac{|\vec{v}|^2}{r}\\
		|\vec{v_{\text{top}}}|&=\sqrt{|\vec{a_c}|r} \label{eq:min-vel}\\

		&=\SI{3.08}{\meter\per\second} \quad (2\, \text{d.p.})

	The following equations solve for the "lift" (emulated by tension) force at the bottom of the modeled vertical loop with tension force.

	In the data, we can see that at the bottom of the vertical loop (i.e. at the peaks of the graph) it has $F_{T_\text{bottom}}\approx \SI{5.12}{\newton} \quad (2\, \text{d.p.})$. This is marginally less than the calculated value, which is expected as air resistance is not taken into account in the calculations. In a real world scenario, the air resistance causes a minor proportion of the kinetic energy to convert into other forms, such as thermal energy (heat) and sound energy. That reduction in kinetic energy causes less velocity magnitude, which would cause less lift force at the bottom due to \cref{eq:lift-prop-vel} or in the model, less tension force due to \cref{eq:lift-bottom}.\\
	The calculation also makes use of variables that aren't measured flawlessly accurately/precisely, which introduces some human error into the final calculated value.\\[\ParagraphSpacing]

		&=m_p\left(\frac{|\vec{v}|^2}{r}-|\vec{g}|\right) \label{eq:FNTop}
	\end{align}
	Whereas this would be bottom of loop:
	\begin{align}
		|\vec{F_{N_\text{bottom}}}|&=|\vec{F_{c_p}}|+|\vec{F_{g_p}}|\\
		&=\frac{m_p|\vec{v}|^2}{r}+m_p|\vec{g}|\\
		&=m_p\left(\frac{|\vec{v}|^2}{r}+|\vec{g}|\right) \label{eq:FNBottom}\\

	\Large Sensation of the Ride:\\ \normalsize
	The sensation of a sitting passenger on the glider during the vertical loop will feel ``heavier'' and ``lighter'' (potentially even feel ``weightless'') at different points of the vertical loop. In reality, the passengers weight will always remain constant, but that sensation given is due to the varying normal force of their seat pushing against them. At the top of the loop, due to gravity and lift forces aligning direction, they will feel ``lighter'' than usual (unless velocity is so fast that the seat normal force grows excessively large (\cref{eq:FNTop})). If lift force reduced to zero at the top of the vertical loop (in reality impossible with any positive magnitude of velocity due to \cref{eq:lift-prop-vel}) then the passenger will feel weightless as no normal force from the seat will be pushing towards them. At the bottom of the vertical loop, the passenger is guaranteed to feel ``heavier'' than usual because the support force of the seat is greater than the magnitude of their force of gravity (\cref{eq:N>g}).\\
	If the radius of the vertical loop is small enough and/or the velocity at the bottom of the loop is great enough, it can cause the seat's normal force to be multiple times as great as the persons weight, making them feel multiple times ``heavier'' than they usually are.\\
	A G-Force (gravitational force) is a measure of acceleration that is felt as a multiple of gravity's acceleration, useful for describing the seat's normal force relative to the persons weight.\\
	Because blood is a fluid, as the seats normal force pushes the person with a force magnitude multiple times their own weight (i.e. g-force $>1$) the inertia of the blood will pull it down through the persons body from their head to towards their lower body and legs. If the g-force is adequately high, the heart will fail to pump blood hard enough against this unnaturally excessive acceleration to supply the brain and eyes with oxygen-rich blood. At roughly 3-4g blood flow to the retina in the eyes is reduced and vision typically begins to gray out. At 5-6g or more, the brain begins to lose sufficient oxygen due to the lack of blood leading to a loss of consciousness (passing out).\\[\ParagraphSpacing]
	\Large Maximum speed over an arch without feeling weightless:\\ \normalsize
	\begin{center}
		Criteria for passengers not to feel weightless:\\
		Gravity must exceed the required centripetal force.
		\begin{align}
		|\vec{F_c}| &< |\vec{F_g}|\\
		\frac{m|\vec{v}|^2}{r} &< m|\vec{g}|\\
		\frac{|\vec{v}|^2}{r} &< |\vec{g}|\\
		|\vec{v}|^2&<r|\vec{g}|\\
		|\vec{v}|&<\sqrt{r|\vec{g}|}\\
		\therefore |\vec{v_\text{max}}|&=\sqrt{r|\vec{g}|}
		\end{align}
		Seat normal force equation:
		\begin{align}
			|\vec{F_N}|&=|\vec{F_g}|-|\vec{F_c}|\\
			&=m|\vec{g}|-\frac{m|\vec{v}|^2}{r}
		\end{align}
		Equation only works where $0<|\vec{v}|\leq\sqrt{r|\vec{g}|}$\\
		If $|\vec{v}|\geq\sqrt{r|\vec{g}|}$, then $|\vec{F_N}|=\SI{0}{\newton}$\\[\baselineskip]
		Test - Normal force of seat if $|\vec{v}|=\sqrt{r|\vec{g}|}$
		\begin{align}
			|\vec{F_N}|&=m|\vec{g}|-\frac{m|\vec{v}|^2}{r}\\
			&=m|\vec{g}|-\frac{m\left(\sqrt{r|\vec{g}|}\right)^2}{r}\\
			&=m|\vec{g}|-\frac{mr|\vec{g}|}{r}\\
			&=m|\vec{g}|-m|\vec{g}|\\
			&=\SI{0}{\newton}
		\end{align}
		Which is expected, verifying the answer.

	\Large Parabola Dip and Arch:\\ \normalsize
	If the motion of the glider followed a parabola shaped path it would imitate projectile motion, where the only force acting on an object is gravity. After the transition between the arch and then dipping, the glider and its passengers would free fall at the same rate and there would be no normal force sensation at all.\\
	Keep in mind if humans were outside of the plane during free fall, they would not fall at the same rate as the plane. This is because air resistance is greater relative to weight for an independent human, whereas air resistance is smaller relative to weight for a plane. However this issue is not encountered when the human is within the plane because it effectively shields the human from that air resistance, and the air within the plane falls along with it so it doesn't create noticeable air resistance, hence passengers still feeling weightless despite air around them.\\
	Comparing this to a vertical loop - Sensation of weightlessness may only occur at the peak of the vertical circle (provided velocity was minimum) and definitely can't be maintained for extended periods of time like the parabolic path offers, making it far less optimal of a choice for training astronauts for true weightlessness in space.
	\section{Banked Corner}
	\subsection{Diagrams}
	Note: Air resistance and velocity have been omitted from the following diagrams. Velocity is always tangent to the circular path. Air resistance is always opposite in direction to velocity. Their magnitudes will correlate in that $|\vec{F_R}| \propto |\vec{v}|^2$.\\

			This method shows that $|\vec{F_g}|=|\vec{F_{L_y}}|$, meaning there is no net vertical force. We know this must be true, as during travel around banked corners we don't observe any vertical motion. This relates to Newton's first law (inertia) in the vertical axis.
			Because $\vec{F_g}$ and $\vec{F_{L_y}}$ effectively cancel each other out (or in a real world scenario come extremely close to canceling each other out), that leaves only $\vec{F_{L_x}}$ to contribute towards the net force (also called centripetal force in this case as it points toward center of circular path).
			&
			Another method is to simply add the vectors of the two forces, $\vec{F_g}$ and $\vec{F_L}$ (not to be confused with adding their magnitudes). This also provides its net (or centripetal) force.\\
		\end{tabularx}
	\end{table}
	
	\subsection{Achieved}
	
	When the glider travels around the banked corner, 3 forces are acting on the glider. Lift, air resistance, and gravity. Lift can be broken down into its vertical and horizontal components. Without any vertical acceleration nor velocity, the vertical component of the lift force must be of equal magnitude and opposite direction to the force of gravity acting downwards. This leaves the horizontal component of the lift force to be equal (both in magnitude and direction) to the net, centripetal force (when ignoring the force of air resistance). The magnitude of this centripetal force theoretically always remains constant in order to complete a perfectly circular path.
	\subsection{Merit}
	The lift force must be greater than the gravity force as the vertical component of lift must always be equal in magnitude to gravity to prevent vertical motion.\\
	As the graph shows, the measured tension force (emulating lift) is roughly 1.106N.\\% for reasons previously explained.
	The weight of the glider is:
	\begin{align}
		|\vec{F_g}|&=mg\\

		&\approx \SI{0.877}{\newton} \quad (3\, \text{s.f.})\\[\baselineskip]

Over the time period measured, the tension force varied by a relatively small amount (unavoidable due to the need to flick/shift fingers to maintain motion in the model).
	
	
	
	\subsection{Excellence}
	The force measured in our data is tension. We can calculate it in multiple ways.\\[\baselineskip]
	$r_c$ refers to the radius from the center of the circular path (it ends up canceling out so isn't necessary).\\
	$r_p$ refers to the radius from the pivot of the conical pendulum (i.e. the string length, including additional distance to the center of mass).\\
	$t$ refers to the amount of time it takes for the conical pendulum to complete one loop.

	Each of these methods uses a different combination of 3 measured variables that will introduce varying amounts of human error into the final calculation. Method 3 has a calculated value closest to the correct, measured tension force reflecting that the measured variables used in its equation were measured more accurately and with less human error. All 3 methods are valid, and if data collection (testing conditions and measuring) was flawless they would all produce the same result.\\[\baselineskip]
	The reasoning stated for merit is correct as all calculated values are $\gtrsim\SI{0.877}{\newton} \quad (3\, \text{s.f.})$. The calculated values are slightly different to the values measured by the force meter. This is because due to human error in measuring.\\[\ParagraphSpacing]
	Because gravity and the vertical component of lift cancel out, the passenger's weight should feel more or less normal.\\
	During the ride around the banked corner, the seat will be at an angle. During flight, ``downwards'' is perceived as the direction towards the seat from the passenger (no longer the direction towards Earth's center). Gravity will no longer be pushing the passenger ``downwards'' from their point of view, but rather at an angle. It may seem intuitive to think the passengers will shift/slide in the direction the seat's normal force is pushing them but that's unlikely to actually happen. Despite the passenger feeling an angled normal force from their seat pushing them toward the center of the circular path the glider is traveling, they're unlikely to slide in that direction. This is because of inertia. Passengers rely on force from their surroundings to maintain their centripetal force because they naturally want to resist changes to their motion (newtons first law). When the glider turns, passengers bodies will have a natural tendency to ``want'' to maintain their straight motion due to inertia. This resistance to turning creates a sensation that feels like a force is pushing you outwards (away from the center of the circular path), which is often refereed to as the centrifugal force. This force is fake and does not exist. But relative to their surroundings the sensation of being pushed outwards feels like a force and - despite the normal force pushing them inwards toward the center of circular path - will cause them to feel pushed outwards overall.
