	During motion, 3 forces are acting on the stunt glider:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Gravity ($F_g$) (i.e. Weight) always vertically downwards (i.e. toward center of Earth).
		\item Lift ($F_L$) perpendicular to direction of velocity, toward the center of the circular path.
		\item Air Resistance ($F_R$) (i.e. Friction, Drag) opposite to direction of velocity.
	\end{enumerate}
	For simplicity, air resistance will be ignored as its effects are negligible?\\
	At the top of the loop, the light force has ma
